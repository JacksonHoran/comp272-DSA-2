# My Data Structures and Algorithms 2 assignment portfolio
This repository contains some of the project style assignments that I completed in this course. All of these assignments were individually graded no lower than an 85%. Overall I earned an A in the class.

[**Course Description**](https://catalog.luc.edu/course-descriptions/comp/#:~:text=COMP%20271%C2%A0%C2%A0Data%20Structures%20I%C2%A0%C2%A0(3%20Credit%20Hours)%C2%A0%C2%A0)

## Lessons Learned:
This course introduced me to many foundational topics in programming like time and space complexity, recursion, and abstract data types such as lists, stacks, queues, maps, graphs, and trees. Utilizing Python, I implemented these ADTs using lists while ensuring complete encapsulation, analyzing algorithmic efficiency, and applying object-oriented design principles. The course emphasized problem decomposition, correctness, and performance trade-offs, strengthening my ability to reason about data structures and write scalable, well-structured code.


## Tech and Resources Used: 
Python, Stack Overflow, GeeksForGeeks, LLMs(when clarified in assignment instructions, conceptual questions, and debugging) and, VScode
